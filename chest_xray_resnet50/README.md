#  Chest X-Ray Classification using ResNet50

This project uses **Transfer Learning (ResNet50)** to classify chest X-ray images into **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.

##  Model Details
- Pre-trained ResNet50 model (frozen base)
- Added custom dense layers
- Used `ImageDataGenerator` for preprocessing
- Early stopping callback for better performance

## Results
- Evaluated on test set
- Shows accuracy and prediction visualization
